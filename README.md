Lynx is an AI that plays the abstract board game [Poly-Y](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/418921/star-y-and-poly-y).

Lynx was developed by Lesley Wevers and Steven te Brinke for the 2014 [CodeCup](http://www.codecup.nl/), which it won.

This repository contains a C++ port of the Java code.

The C++ port has been compiled to Javascript using [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten). You can [play against the AI here](https://maksverver.github.io/lynx/)!
